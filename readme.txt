This plugin will resize the video embed code from archive.org to a size that fits nicely with Twenty Eleven Theme.

== Description ==

If you use the Twenty Eleven Theme and regularly embed videos from Internet Archive's Open Source Movies collections you might like this plugin.

This plugin will resize the video embed code from archive.org to a size that fits nicely with Twenty Eleven Theme.

Internet Archive's embed code normally gives you a 640 x 506 video size which breaks the Twenty Eleven Theme and looks odd with other embeded videos. This plugin will overrides the final embed code to 584 x 461 so it fits nicely into the Twenty Eleven Theme.
